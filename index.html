                <p> As greatly as Black woman are praised for their beauty, people have taken advantage of them in many ways. Black woman are of course proud to be black, it makes us strong and feel like we can do anything.</p>

                 <h2 style="font-family:Georgia">LGBTQ+ Community</h2>
                 <p> While the community is loves by allies and other fellow queers, some are not as polite. The community is proud to be themselves and be accepted into society as equals yet there are some people who refuse to belive their choice of identity.</p>

                 <p> Not much is spoken about BW in the community, usually because of their fear of being caught and disdained by their family. Nobody should feel like this yet it is a common accurance in conservative/traditional black families.</p>
